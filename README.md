## Brainfuck interpreter 

[Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) is an esoteric programming language created in 1993 by Urban MÃ¼ller.

This app is an interactive interpreter of Brainfuck written in JavaScript. 

A unique feature of this interpreter is some kind of a 'visual memory'.

The language itself doesn't have any visual output features. But what if we treat all its memory as a 'visual memory'? Every byte of the memory can be represented as a visible pixel. The pixel's color will depend on the byte's value. So now we can paint in Brainfuck!
